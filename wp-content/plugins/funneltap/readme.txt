== Installation ==

Before proceeding please make sure that you are running WordPress 3.5 or above.

Please refer to the WordPress documentation on how to get the plugin to appear in your installation admin section.

Once the plugin appears in your installation, you must activate it. Navigate to the "Plugins" section and locate the "Funneltap" plugin. The activation is done simply by clicking the "Activate" link next to the plugin name in the list.

Once you have activated the plugin and added the necessary actions, you need to configure the plugin. The plugins configuration page can be found under the "Settings > Funneltap".

Once the plugin is activated campaigns and there respective reports can be managed via http://stageapp.funneltap.ai/


The configuration page consists of two settings:

* Browser Push
	* Http / Https (choose https if your website have a valid SSL certificate running on HTTPS. If you don't own any certificate, you can select HTTP.)
* On-Site Push Notification : Enable or disable to activate the same

All of the above settings are needed for the plugin to work. You do not need to add Funneltap javascript manually to your store.


The plugin uses the WordPress Action API to add content to the website. However, there are a few actions that will have to be added to the wordpress theme in order for the plugin to function to its full extent.

* Tracking/sending event can be done using our API
	* funneltap.track(eventName, eventValue);
* Users can be mapped using our API
	* funneltap.identify(userInfo, force, callback);
* Indexing product using our API. It's recommended to use this API only if you are following SPA(Single page architecture).
	* funneltap.index(productInfo);
